# Welcome to Lanc0r's DDSS Guides

Welcome to my collection of guides for Dungeons, Dragons & Space Shuttles. This is a repository of instructions and walkthrough's that cover everything from getting the server up and running, your first few days in-game all the way to harvesting resources on Jupiter.

## Where are the guides?
The guides can be found under the repository [Wiki tab](https://github.com/Lanc0r/rbp-ddss/wiki). You can find them organized on the home page into arbitrary categories.
