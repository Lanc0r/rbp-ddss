# Welcome to Lanc0r's DDSS Guides

Welcome to my collection of guides for Dungeons, Dragons & Space Shuttles. This is a repository of instructions and walkthrough's that cover everything from getting the server up and running, your first few days in-game all the way to harvesting resources on Jupiter.

## Where are the guides?
The guides can be found under the repository [Wiki tab](https://github.com/Lanc0r/rbp-ddss/wiki). You can find them organized on the home page into arbitrary categories.

## Why does this exist?
We're huge fans of the Dungeons, Dragons & Space Shuttles modpack. We've created and played on a half-dozen or more DDSS servers over the years. Figured it was about time to document what we learn as we go to help ourselves for next time and maybe a few other people along the way.
